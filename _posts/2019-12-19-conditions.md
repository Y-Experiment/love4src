title: How this works - the first approach
---

Its impossible to know the future before it comes, so we'll try to keep it simple at the start, and hopefully improve as we progress.

We appreciate existing online projects promoting Information Technology and hope to provide an additional perspective built on *open, opinionated, and personal* discussions of seasoned software makers. 

We will talk about pretty much anything that captures the imagination or challenges the *software maker*.
Due to the open formula of the love4src conversations, it is expected that the discussion will drift among at least the several topics pre-selected for the episode. 
We will try to group and match these topics to our hosts so they can be comfortably talked about at the time of the recording. 

As much as we can't make any guarantees, we'll attempt to minimize and ideally avoid several things we consider harmful in the context of love4src. 
Here are some of these *rules of thumb*:
* no promotion/bashing of personal agenda or brands,
* no bullshit or meaningless nonsense,
* no hurt feelings or pointless drama.

If in doubt [feel free to submit your input](https://github.com/Y-Experiment/love4src/issues/new) :)

Thanks and hope you will enjoy the show!
