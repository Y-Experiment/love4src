title: How this works - the first approach
---

Its impossible to know the future before it comes, so: we'll try to keep it simple at the start, and hopefully improve as we progress.

We appreciate multiple existing online projects promoting the knowledge of Information Technology and hope to provide an additional perspective built from *open, opinionated, and personal* discussions of seasoned software makers. 

Due to the open formula of our conversations, it is expected that the discussion will drift among at least the several topics pre-selected for the episode. We will try to group and match these topics to our hosts so they can be comfortably talked about at the time of the recording. We will talk about pretty much anything that captures the imagination or challenges a stereotypical software maker.

As much as we can't make any guarantees, we'll attempt to minimize or ideally avoid several things we consider harmful in the context of love4src. Here are some of these *rules of thumb*:
* no promotion/bashing of personal agenda or brands,
* no bullshit or meaningless nonsense,
* no hurt feelings or pointless drama.

If in doubt - let us know :)

Thanks and hope you will enjoy the show!
