title: How this works - the first approach
---

Its impossible to know the future before it comes, so: we'll try to keep it simple at the start, and hopefully improve as we progress.

We appreciate multiple existing online projects promoting the knowledge of Information Technology and hope to provide an additional perspective built from *open, opinionated, and personal* discussions of seasoned software makers. 

Due to the open formula of our conversations, it is expected that the discussion will drift among at least the several topics pre-selected for the episode. We will try to group and match these topics to our hosts so they can be comfortably talked about at the time of the recording.

As much as we can't make any guarantees, we'll attempt to minimize or ideally avoid several things we consider harmful in the context of love4src. Here are some of these *rules of thumb*:
* no promotion/bashing of personal agenda or brands,
* no bullshit or meaningless nonsense,
* no hurt feelings or pointless drama.



Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
