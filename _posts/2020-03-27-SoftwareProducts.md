title: 01 - Software Products

[*We're happy to share, the first episode - a free form chat about the products in the times of coronavirus.*](https://www.love4src.com/episodes/01SoftwareProducts.mp3)

[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZmLPmH_pcR8) or [Listen on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/love4src/01-software-products) 

We've tried to observe some of the obvious (and sometimes funny) consequences to the product landscape and how our
lives are evolving. The zeitgeist is so obvious that its really hard to avoid it, especially as it is happening :)
We've also tried to comment on the possible larger shifts in the software production ecosystem, the role of platforms 
and individuals, global and local, etc.   

This evolved into a rapid exchange of ideas. We hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did :)
