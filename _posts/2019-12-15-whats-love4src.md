title: What's love4src?
---

Software has entered the mainstream at the turn of the centuries and by now, pretty much everyone has an opinion on it. 

I'm sure every software maker has experienced the frustration of dealing with myths surrounding our domain. We've all had countless discussions, trying to bridge the gaps in understanding of: how software works, what is it good for, how to build it, why it is important, and why we will use more of it every day. 

Love4src aims to enhance such discussions with modern publishing technologies allowing them to be heard, reflected upon, and commented the-hell-out-of.

Instead of evangelizing software tech, brands or people, let's talk about the controversies and challenges related to building software: systems, businesses, teams, culture, evolution, intelligence... Let's talk about software eating the world.

For the curious minds, my personal motivation is to have a place where I can talk to people about software and share those conversations with you, so that perhaps you'll join in and add your input.
